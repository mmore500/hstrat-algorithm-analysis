\section{Additional notes on the memory requirements of perfect tracking} \label{sec:perfect-tracking-space-supp}
% TODO: section name that isn't monstorously long

Note that perfect phylogeny tracking algorithms are designed to plug into a larger computational process.
For phylogeny tracking to be relevant, this computational process must have a collection of $N$ objects that are currently eligilble to be copied (in evolutionary terms, the population).
Therefore, the space complexity of this process must be at least $\mathcal{O}(N)$.
As long as the expected size of $T$ scales no faster than $\mathcal{O}(N)$, then, phylogeny tracking will not be the primary factor determining memory usage.
While the memory cost of phylogeny tracking could still be significant in these cases, it is unlikely to be the primary factor determining whether running the program is tractable.

Previously, we noted that cases where perfect tracking with pruning achieves its worst case size order of growth are esoteric.
There are two ways that theses situations can occur:

1. $N$ is continuously increasing.
2. There is effectively no coalescence.
