Remaining exposition in this paper is structured as follows:
\begin{itemize}
% \item Section \ref{sec:methods} covers preliminaries and glossarizes key terminology,
\item Section \ref{sec:annotation-algorithms} surveys a suite of streaming curation algorithms, introducing intuition, presenting the formal definition, proving self-consistent stratum discard sequencing, and demonstrating resolution and collection size properties.
% TODO make sure this gets into the actual text
\item Section \ref{sec:reconstruction-algorithm} presents a recently-developed algorithm for full-tree reconstruction from hereditary stratigraphic annotation data and analyzes its runtime characteristics.
% \item Section \ref{sec:perfect-tracking-algorithm} supplies formal presentation of the alternate perfect phylogenetic tracking algorithm and analysis of its runtime characteristics then commentates on which situations better suit perfect tracking over hereditary stratigraphy, and vice versa.
% TODO do we need a results and discussion section???
% \item Section \ref{sec:results-and-discussion}
\item Section \ref{sec:conclusion} reflects on broader implications and future work, and
\item we include a Glossary of terminology related to hereditary stratigraphy, streaming curation, and phylogenetics in the Appendix.
\end{itemize}
