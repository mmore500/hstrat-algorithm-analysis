\section{Introduction} \label{sec:introduction}

Here, you should discuss the importance of your paper within the context of prior work, and describe the key technical and conceptual ideas used to achieve its main claims. This section should be addressed to a broad spectrum of theoretical computer science and discrete mathematics researchers.

\begin{itemize}
\item we present these algorithms in the context of distributed phylogenetic tracking, but the presented stratum-retention policy algorithms can be more generally applied in any scenario involving online (in the sense of ongoing) record-keeping with limited space and multiple or unknown reading time points
\item mention data loss
\item mention potential fossil-based approach to ancestral state estimation
\end{itemize}
