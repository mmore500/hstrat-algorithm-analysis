\subsection{Fixed Resolution (FR) Policy Algorithm}
\label{sec:fixed-resolution-algo}

The fixed resolution (FR) policy algorithm adopts a simplistic strategy: retain observation time points at intervals of a user-specified factor $r$.
This procedure equates to naive downsampling via decimation \citep[p. 31]{crochiere1983multirate}.
We include discussion of this policy algorithm primarily for completeness.

The set of items retained under fixed resolution is defined as,
\begin{align}
\colorK^{\mathsf{FR}}_r(\colorT)
&\coloneq \{
\colorTbar \in [0\twodots\colorT)
: \colorTbar \bmod r = 0 \text{ or } \colorTbar = \colorT - 1
\}.
\label{eqn:fr_kept}
\end{align}
We demonstrate self-consistency over elapsed time $\colorT$ in Suplementary Theorem \ref{thm:fixed-resolution-algo-self-consistency}.

The procedures to decide eliminated time points during the update process and to enumerate retained observation times are trivial, given in Supplementary Algorithms \ref{alg:fixed-resolution-algo-gen-drop-ranks} and \ref{alg:fixed-resolution-algo-enum-retained-ranks}.
Pruning targets time points that are not multiples of the fixed resolution $r$ and enumeration traverses time points at an even stride $r$ until reaching record depth.
Unsurprisingly, order of growth for the record size is $\mathcal{O}(n)$ under this algorithm, owing to the number of retained observations scaling as $\approx n / r$.


% Algorithms \ref{alg:fixed-resolution-algo-gen-drop-ranks} and \ref{alg:fixed-resolution-algo-enum-retained-ranks} provide these procedures formally.


% A simple justification can be given: record depth $n$ provides an upper bound for extant record size because, being strictly subtractive, pruned size cannot exceed record depth.
% Likewise, the downsampling factor $r$ enforces an upper bound $r$ on gap size between retained observations.
% Any larger gap size would require at least one time point multiple of $r$ to have been discarded.

The FR policy algorithm's defining feature is that it guarantees stable absolute accuracy.
Such an approach is necessary for scenarios that tolerate only rigid observational uncertainties.
However, because extant record size grows linearly, this policy does not suit applications expecting long observational duration, high-frequency observation, or storage limitation.
Figure \ref{fig:retention-policies} includes a time-lapse of the extant record under the FR policy algorithm.
