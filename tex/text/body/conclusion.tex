\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

We have presented an approach to distributed tracking of replicating digital artifacts, with particular applications to .

This is ready to be used in practice, with an existing public-facing open source library implementation \citep{moreno2022hstrat}.

Future work will investigate storage-aware to simplify and optimize applications (hereditary stratigraphic surfaces).
