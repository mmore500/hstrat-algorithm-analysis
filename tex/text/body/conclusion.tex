\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

We have documented the algorithmic backing of the emerging ``hereditary stratigraphy'' methodology for distributed lineage tracking of replicating digital artifacts.
This method works by annotating replicating entities with a heritable annotation, and then comparing end-state annotations after the fact to estimate their phylogenetic relationships --- akin to how biologists infer phylogenetic relationships from biosequeences.
We have shown the underlying mechanism of hereditary to be an instance of a more general ``streaming curation'' problem.
This problem requires online subsampling of a rolling observation stream to balance requirements to maintain coverage of retained observations over stream history and to limit the number of retained observations.
In addition to hereditary stratigraphy, the streaming curation problem matches to use cases involving memory-constrainged data logger or wiresless sensor network devices.
We identify five policy algorithms that provide different size/coverage trade-offs for the streaming curation problem, and provide procedures to enact them efficiently.

We then explore postprocessing algorithms used to compare and interpret hereditary stratigraphic annotations.
In particular, we sketch a trie-based tree reconstruction algorithm that proceeds from the underlying structure of the hereditary stratigraphy annotation.
As a point of comparison, we provide an algorithmic formalization of the established perfect-tracking algorithms currently standard in agent-based evolutionary modeling.
%TODO talk about the take away of comparing the two

Much future work remains.
We are particularly interested in adapting hereditary stratigraphy to even more effectively make use of space in fixed-capacity contexts and minimize rearrangement of strata in the underlying annotation data structure (e.g., array of strata) during the update process.
One promising direction involves adapting retention policies to directly specify the index position of strata to deposit over rather than the semantic deposit times of strata to prune.
%TODO more future work

Ultimately, our interest in hereditary stratigraphy and streaming curation is application-driven.
To these ends, reference implementatons of most algorithms described are provided in the accompanying, public-facing \texttt{hstrat} Python library \citep{moreno2022hstrat}.
This library enables application of hereditary stratigraphy and streaming curation techniques in a few lines of code.
