\begin{theorem}{Geometric Sequence $n$th Root Self-Consistency}
\label{thm:geom-seq-nth-root-algo-self-consistency}
Let $\mathsf{GSNR\_kept}(n)$ be the set of data points retained at time point $n$, defined per Equation \ref{eqn:gsnr_kept}.
Showing self-consistency requires that we demonstrate $\forall m \geq 0, n \in [0 \twodots m)$,
\begin{align*}
\mathsf{GSNR\_kept}(n)
\geq
\mathsf{GSNR\_kept}(m)
\setminus
\mathsf{future}(n, m).
\end{align*}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
\label{prf:geom-seq-nth-root-algo-self-consistency}
Showing our self-consistency for all $S_x(n)$ implies self-consistency for $\mathsf{GSNR\_kept}(\colorT)$.
So, let's consider a subset component $S_x(n)$ individually.

Why are time points $S_x(n)$ guaranteed to be a subset of $S_x(n-1) \cup \{n\}$ (i.e., self-consistency)?
Consider several non-mutually exclusive possible scenarios that could occur when transitioning from $n - 1$ to $n$,
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $\kappa$ changes: $\kappa(n - 1) \neq \kappa(n)$.

  Because $\kappa$ is monotonically increasing, $\kappa(n - 1) < \kappa(n)$.
  Binary flooring procedures have ensured $\kappa(n - 1)$ and $\kappa(n)$ are perfect powers of 2.
  Thus, $\kappa(n)$ is an even multiple of $\kappa(n - 1)$.
  So,
  \begin{align*}
    &\{\, t \mid \beta(n) \leq t < n \text{ and } t \bmod \kappa(n) = 0 \,\}\\
    &\subseteq \{\, t \mid \beta(n) \leq t < n \text{ and } t \bmod \kappa(n - 1) = 0 \,\}.
  \end{align*}
  Also, because $\beta$ monotonically increasing, $\beta{n - 1} \leq \beta{n}$.

  In conjunction, these stipulations give us $S_x(n) \subseteq \{S_x(n - 1), n\}$.
  % ELD: indentation is kind of wonky here

  \item $\beta$ changes: $\beta(n - 1) \neq \beta(n)$.

  Because $\beta$ is monotonically increasing, $\beta(n - 1) < \beta(n)$.
  We have $\beta(n) \bmod \kappa(n) = 0$.
  Because $\kappa(n)$ is an even multiple of $\kappa(n - 1)$, we have $\beta(n) \bmod \kappa(n - 1) = 0$.
  This implies $\beta(n) \in S_x(n - 1)$.
  Because $\beta$ monotonically increasing, change in $\beta$ strictly shrinks $S_x(n)$.

  \item $n \bmod \kappa(n) = 0$

  Then the observation at time point $n$ is claimed for inclusion within $S_x(n)$.
  It is available, having just presently occurred.

\end{enumerate}

Note that if none of the above occur, then $S_x(n - 1) = S_x(n)$.
Any combination of the above maintains $S_x(n - 1) \in \{S_x(n), n\}$
\end{proof}
