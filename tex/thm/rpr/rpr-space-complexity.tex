\begin{theorem}{Recency-proportional Resolution Space Complexity}
\label{thm:recency-proportional-resolution-algo-space-complexity}

The \gls{extant record size} of the Recency-proportional Resolution Policy Algorithm grows with order $\mathcal{\theta}{(r \log \colorT)}$ where $r$ is a user-provided resolution and $\colorT$ is current logical time.

\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
\label{prf:recency-proportional-resolution-algo-space-complexity}

Algorithm \ref{alg:recency-proportional-algo-gen-drop-ranks} determines the array of strata to be dropped at any given time point.
Observe that whenever $2 \mid \colorT$ at least one stratum will be dropped.
More generally, for any positive integer $i \le \log_2 \colorT$, we have that if $2^i \mid \colorT$ then $i$ strata will be dropped.
Thus, the number of dropped strata is bounded above by $\sum_{i=1}^{\log_2 \colorT} \colorT = \colorT \log_2 \colorT$.
As such, the number of retained strata is bound by $\colorT - \colorT \log_2 \colorT \le \log_2 \colorT$ for all positive $\colorT$.
Given that no strata are dropped when $\frac{n}{2} - 1 < k,$ we observe that the output array of this policy algorithm is bound above by $\mathcal{O}{(r \log \colorT)}.$
Via \ref{sec:extant_record_oog}, we can conclude that this bound is actually $\mathcal{\theta}{(r \log \colorT)}.$
\end{proof}
