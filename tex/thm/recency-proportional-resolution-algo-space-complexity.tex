\begin{theorem}{Recency-proportional Resolution Space Complexity}
\label{thm:recency-proportional-resolution-algo-space-complexity}

The \gls{extant record size} of the Recency-proportional Resolution Policy Algorithm grows with order $\mathcal{theta}{(k \log{n})}.$

\end{theorem}


As per \ref{subsec:extant_record_oog}, we will set out to prove that output array of this policy algorithm has an order of growth of $\mathcal{theta}{(k \log{n})}.$
